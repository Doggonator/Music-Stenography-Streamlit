This program is intended to streamline and accelerate the process of writing down song ideas for musicians and composers who just want to use their computer keyboard
Each note is composed of:
-Each tone
-The length of the note

Notes can be anything from whole-32nd. Assumes whole note is 4 beats, etc
whole = w
half = h
quarter = q
eight = i
sixteenth = s
thirty-second = t
If the note is dotted, add a period (.)
So, a dotted quarter note would start with "q."

Tones are also simple
Tones are composed with their name (a-g) and their octave (number) (i.e. a4).
If the note is sharp, add a #
If the note is flat, add a -

(Also note that as long as notes are split by whitespace (space (if chord) or linebreak (enter/return[when defining a new note])), they do not need to be in any specific order)

So, a complete note looks as followed (This is a dotted half with a c4 and an a4)
(Note that tones need a space in between them)
h.a4 c4

Notes are seperated by linebreaks
h.a4 c4
ie4 g4


An input must also contain tempo on the first line (bpm of quarter note)

So, a complete input file could look like:
120 
h.a4 c4
ie4 g4


If you wish to add rests, treat the rest like a tone in a note, but make sure not to add any other tones to that note
Half note rest i.e.:
hr

So, a complete input file with a rest could look like:
120 
h.a4 c4
h.r
ie-4 g#4

Repeats are also implemented!
For example
<
he5 c5
> 
will output he5 c5 twice (1 repeat is default)
<
he5 c5
>2
will also output he5 c5 twice (if a number is specified, the segment in the repeat will be played that number of times)

If you put a closing repeat before an opening repeat, the repeat is ignored.
i.e.
120
he5
>

Also make sure to not include tempo in the repeat (make sure if repeating to the start that the tempo is not included). As well as this, do not put repeats within each other.

Repeats within each other (don't do):
120
<
he5
<
c5
>
>

Note that if an error occurs within a repeat, the error traceback may not be accurate in terms of line number
